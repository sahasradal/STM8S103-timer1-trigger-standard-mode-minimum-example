# STM8S103-timer1-trigger-standard-mode-minimum-example
timer1 trigger standard mode eaample. The TI2 input is used as the trigger chanel which is tied to PC7. This is the implementation of RM0016 user manual example. PD4 is used to toggle an LED when the timer1 counter overflows. On power up the counter is initialised but doesnt start counting. On receiving a high on PC7 (TI2) the counter starts counting and toggles the LED on each overflow. The option byte AFRO0 has to be programmed to enable PC7 as Timer1_inputchanel_1. This can be done by selecting the AFRO0 in STVP software option byte tab. The whole STVD project is upladed.
